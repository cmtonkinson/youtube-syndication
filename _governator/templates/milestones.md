# Project Milestones
> This document defines the **delivery phases (milestones)** of the project.
> Each milestone represents a **demo-able system state** with explicit intent,
> scope, and exit criteria.  
>
> Milestones exist to preserve sequencing rationale, prevent scope drift,
> and provide clear review gates.

## Milestone Map
| ID | Name | Outcome (One-liner) |
|----|------|---------------------|
| M0 |      |                     |
| M1 |      |                     |
| M2 |      |                     |

> Notes:
> - Use as few milestones as necessary.
> - Small or trivial projects may have just a single "Delivery" milestone.

## Milestone M0 — _[Name]_

### Outcome
A short, concrete description of the system state at completion of this milestone.
Must be something that can be demonstrated, tested, or reviewed.

### Why This Milestone Exists
What risk does this milestone retire?  
What does it unlock for subsequent work?

### In Scope
- Explicitly included capabilities, surfaces, or guarantees
- Keep this list tight and declarative

### Out of Scope
- Explicit non-goals for this milestone
- Anything intentionally deferred to later milestones

### Acceptance / Exit Criteria
The milestone is considered complete when:
- [ ] Observable condition (command works, endpoint responds, UI renders, etc.)
- [ ] Tests pass / artifacts exist
- [ ] Quality bar met (security, performance, DX, etc., as appropriate)

### Dependencies & Assumptions
- External systems, approvals, data, or prior milestones
- Assumptions that materially affect feasibility or design

### Notes / Constraints
Optional.
Key constraints, guardrails, or context worth preserving.

## Milestone M1 — _[Name]_

_(Repeat the same structure as above)_

## Milestone Sequencing Rationale
A brief explanation of why milestones are ordered this way.
Call out any intentional trade-offs (e.g. speed vs completeness).
