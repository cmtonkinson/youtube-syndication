# Task 000: Architecture Discovery (Existing Project)

## Objective
Establish a safe, minimal architectural baseline for an existing system by
discovering and summarizing the current state of documentation and decisions.
Do not redesign the system. Focus on inventory, clarity, and gaps.

## Required Output
Create `_governator/docs/existing-system-discovery.md` using the template in
`_governator/templates/existing-system-discovery.md`.

## Discovery Rules
- Read `GOVERNATOR.md`.
- Identify and list all relevant architecture artifacts already present in the repo.
- Do not invent new requirements or architecture decisions.
- Do not create new feature or implementation tasks.

## Definition of Done
This task is complete when:
- `existing-system-discovery.md` is created and filled out.
- Existing docs are inventoried with paths and short summaries.
- Gaps and uncertainties are explicitly called out.
- No new architecture is introduced.
