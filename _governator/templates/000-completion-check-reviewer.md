# Task 000: Completion Check (Reviewer)

## Objective
Determine whether the project is complete relative to `GOVERNATOR.md`:
- Are all stated requirements met?
- Are all stated constraints met?
- Does the current state of the project generally conform with any listed "soft"
  aspirations? (e.g. mission, vision, philosophy, etc)

## Inputs
- The main project `GOVERNATOR.md` file.
- Any/all architecture artifacts under `_governator/docs/`.
- Relevant project source code, tests, configuration files, templates, etc.

## Output
In your review JSON comments, be exhaustive. Whether accepting or rejecting
overall, be sure to independently address compliance with:
- Every listed requirement
- Every listed constraint
